# Template

EECE2080C template Reference
Revised 20-Sep-2022

Objective: The goal of this repo is meant to show how to translate a implementation of ADT that is specific to a data type (like int), and translate it to a template.

This code is taken as starting point from https://github.com/olekaspt/Lab01

# NonTempalte Implementation
I took the files form Lab01 and renamed then.  I also renamed the classes to reflect the file names.

* Node.cpp and Node.h -> NodeNonTemplate.cpp NodeNonTempalte.h
* LinkedList.cpp and LinkedList.h -> LinkedListNonTemplate.cpp LinkedListNonTempalte.h
* tests.cpp -> testsOld.cpp
* main.cpp -> mainOld.cpp
